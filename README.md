[Aug 2024] AF-Cluster can be combined with random seeds and MSA subsampling in [this Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HWaymentSteele/AF_Cluster/blob/main/AF_cluster_in_colabdesign.ipynb)

[Jan 2024] An exact set of methods to reproduce every structure prediction in the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/HWaymentSteele/AF_Cluster/blob/567f2c85213d0aaf81834cec144a662d113d7d62/complete_methods.md).

[Jan 2023] (DEP, use ColabDesign based notebook above). Run the entirety of the script in a Colab Notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HWaymentSteele/AF_Cluster/blob/main/AFcluster.ipynb)!



## Usage

### To generate MSA:

All MSAs used in this manuscript were generated using the [ColabFold notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb).

### To cluster MSA and generate subsampled MSA files:

`python scripts/ClusterMSA.py EX -i initial_msa.a3m -o msas`

Outputs a directory named `msas` that contains

	- msas/EX_000.a3m
	- msas/EX_001.a3m
	...
	- msas/EX_REF.a3m
	- msas/EX_U10-000.a3m
	- msas/EX_U10-001.a3m
	...
	- msas/EX_U100-000.a3m
	- msas/EX_U100-001.a3m
	...
	- msas/EX_REF.a3m
	- msas/EX_clustering_assignments.tsv
	-msas/EX_cluster_metadata.tsv

`EX_000.a3m`, `EX_001.a3m` ... are the clusters identified by DBSCAN.

`EX_U10-000.a3m, ... EX_U10-009.a3m` are uniformly sampled control MSAs of size 10 (Default is to generate 10).

`EX_U100-000.a3m, ... EX_U100-009.a3m` are uniformly sampled control MSAs of size 100 (Default is to generate 10).

`EX_REF.a3m` is a copy of the original MSA.

`EX_clustering_assignments.tsv` contains a list of original sequences and the cluster index they were assigned to (-1 means they were not assigned).

`EX_cluster_metadata.tsv` contains metadata corresponding to clusters.

To also perform PCA and/or tSNE embedding at the same time and save it in `EX_clustering_assignments.tsv` for later analysis:

`python scripts/ClusterMSA.py -i <my_alignment.a3m> -o <outdir> --run_PCA`

or

`python scripts/ClusterMSA.py -i <my_alignment.a3m> -o <outdir> --run_tSNE`

### To run AF2:

`python scripts/RunAF2.py`

See https://github.com/jproney/AF2Rank for more information on compiling an AlphaFold2 installation.

### To run MSA Transformer:

`python scripts/runESM.py -i <my_subMSA.a3m> -o <outdir>`

### To calculate RMSD to provided reference structure(s):

`python scripts/CalculateModelFeatures.py path/to/pdbs/* -o <my_output_file>.json --ref_struct REF_PDB.pdb`
